\f0\fs24 \cf0 Madam President, coinciding with this year' s first part-session of the European Parliament, a date has been set, unfortunately for next Thursday, in Texas in America, for the execution of a young 34 year-old man who has been sentenced to death. We shall call him Mr Hicks. At the request of a French Member, Mr Zimeray, a petition has already been presented, which many people signed, including myself.\
